## Introduction
Knowledge Graph Attention Network (KGAT) is a new recommendation framework tailored to knowledge-aware personalized recommendation. Built upon the graph neural network framework, KGAT explicitly models the high-order relations in collaborative knowledge graph to provide better recommendation with item side information.

## Environment Requirement
The code has been tested running under Python 3.6.5. The required packages are as follows:
* tensorflow == 1.12.0
* numpy == 1.15.4
* scipy == 1.1.0
* sklearn == 0.20.0

## Reproducibility & Example to Run the Codes
To demonstrate the reproducibility of the best performance reported in our paper and faciliate researchers to track whether the model status is consistent with ours, we provide the best parameter settings (might be different for the custormized datasets) in the scripts, and provide [the log for our trainings](https://github.com/xiangwang1223/knowledge_graph_attention_network/tree/master/Log).

The instruction of commands has been clearly stated in the codes (see the parser function in Model/utility/parser.py).

Some important arguments:
* `model_type`
  * It specifies the type of model.
  * Here we provide six options, including KGAT and five baseline models:
    * `kgat` (by default), proposed in [KGAT: Knowledge Graph Attention Network for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07854), KDD2019. Usage: `--model_type kgat`.
    * `bprmf`, proposed in [BPR: Bayesian Personalized Ranking from Implicit Feedback](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1795167), UAI2009. Such model only uses user-item interactions. Usage: `--model_type bprmf`.
    * `fm`, proposed in [Fast context-aware recommendations with factorization machines](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2010002), SIGIR2011. Usage: `--model_type fm`.
    * `nfm`, proposed in [Neural Factorization Machines for Sparse Predictive Analytics](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3080777), SIGIR2017. Usage: `--model_type nfm`.
    * `cke`, proposed in [Collaborative Knowledge Base Embedding for Recommender Systems](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2939673), KDD2016. Usage: `--model_type cke`.
    * `cfkg`, proposed in [Learning Heterogeneous Knowledge Base Embeddings for Explainable Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03352), Algorithm2018. Usage: `--model_type cfkg`.
  * You can find other baselines, such as RippleNet, MCRec, and GC-MC, in Github.

* `alg_type`
  * It specifies the type of graph convolutional layer.
  * Here we provide three options:
    * `kgat` (by default), proposed in [KGAT: Knowledge Graph Attention Network for Recommendation](xx), KDD2019. Usage: `--alg_type kgat`.
    * `gcn`, proposed in [Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJU4ayYgl), ICLR2018. Usage: `--alg_type gcn`.
    * `graphsage`, propsed in [Inductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs.](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6703-inductive-representation-learning-on-large-graphs.pdf), NeurIPS2017. Usage: `--alg_type graphsage`.
    

* `adj_type`
  * It specifies the type of laplacian matrix where each entry defines the decay factor between two connected nodes.
  * Here we provide two options:
    * `si` (by default), where each decay factor between two connected nodes (say, x->y) is set as 1/(out degree of x), while each node is also assigned with 1 for self-connections. Usage: `--adj_type si`.
    * `bi`, where each decay factor between two connected nodes (say, x->y) is set as 1/sqrt((out degree of x)*(out degree of y)). Usage: `--adj_type bi`.
    
* `mess_dropout`
  * It indicates the message dropout ratio, which randomly drops out the outgoing messages. Usage `--mess_dropout [0.1,0.1,0.1]`.
  
* `pretrain`
  * Please note that, as million-scale knowledge graphs are involved in the recommendation task, it is strongly suggested to use the trained user and item embeddings of BPR-MF to initialize the user and item embeddings of all models (including all baselines and our KGAT) by setting the hyperparameter `pretrain` as `-1`.
  * If you would like to train all models from scratch, please set the hyperparameter `pretrain` as `0`. In this case, please set the number of epoch and the criteria of early stopping larger.

## Dataset
We provide three processed datasets: Amazon-book, Last-FM, and Yelp2018.
* You can find the full version of recommendation datasets via [Amazon-book](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon), [Last-FM](http://www.cp.jku.at/datasets/LFM-1b/), and [Yelp2018](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge).
* We follow [KB4Rec](https://github.com/RUCDM/KB4Rec) to preprocess Amazon-book and Last-FM datasets, mapping items into Freebase entities via title matching if there is a mapping available.
